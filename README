Hello,

I am reading the eloquentjavascript.net website and each time there is an exercise, I write the code myself without looking at the proposed solution. Finally I compare my code with the solution and upgrade my code if needed.

There is a file for each chapter of the website. I enjoy keeping a trace on github of this journey.

Regards
David
