Hi,

I read the first 6 chapters of eloquentjavascript.net website and each time there was an exercise, I wrote the code myself without looking at the proposed solution (this is mandatory is you want to progress). Finally I compared my code with the solution and upgraded my code if needed.

I enjoyed keeping a trace on github of this journey.

I was not really convinced by the chapter 8 about object-oriented programming and specially the short explanation about prototypes, so I switched to the book "Secrets of the Javascript Ninja". If you are a JavaScript beginner like me, reading the part 2 "Apprentice training" related to functions, closures and objects will finally make it clear.
