Hi,

I am reading eloquentjavascript.net website and each time there is an exercise, I write the code myself without looking at the proposed solution. Finally I compare my code with the solution and upgrade my code if my design is not as efficient as the book solution.

This github repository keeps a trace of this journey.

Hereunder when you click on a chapter, the list of the related exercices are displayed. If you click on the exercice "Run" button, the related code exercice is run and the result is displayed.

Cheers
David

PS: In parallel I am reading the book "Secrets of the Javascript Ninja", see my other repo.
